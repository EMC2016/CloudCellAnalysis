### Cell Viewer will help researchers visualize and analysis data in an easy way.

-- Web apps make scRNA-seq data analysis more **accessible** to researchers without extensive computational expertise.

-- Provide **standardized and reproducible analysis**, which is crucial for ensuring consistent results across different studies.

-- More **advanced visualization** that help in the interpretation of complex datasets, allowing users to visualize data in various formats that highlight different aspects of the data, such as gene expression patterns, clustering of cell types. 

-- Offer **interactive analysis** capabilities, allowing users to tweak parameters and instantly see how changes affect results
